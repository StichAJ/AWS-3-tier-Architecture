In this project, I designed and implemented a highly scalable and secure AWS 3-Tier Architecture, tailored to support businesses requiring efficiency, security, and optimized performance for their applications. This approach benefits industries that rely on consistent availability and seamless user experiences, such as e-commerce, fintech, SaaS platforms, healthcare systems, and digital media streaming.

## Best Fit Businesses for 3-Tier Architecture
# 1. E-Commerce & Retail 
	• Online storefronts with dynamic product catalogs
	• Businesses needing secure payment processing and order management
	• Scalable solutions for seasonal traffic spikes
# 2. Financial & Banking Platforms 
	• Secure transaction processing & fraud detection
	• High-speed computing for financial analytics
	• Regulatory-compliant data encryption & storage
# 3. SaaS & Enterprise Applications 
	• Multi-tenant software solutions requiring scalability & API integrations
	• Cloud-based platforms handling large-scale user interactions
	• Secure backend data processing & authentication
# 4. Healthcare & Telemedicine 
	• HIPAA-compliant patient data storage and secure access
	• Remote healthcare systems needing reliable communication layers
	• AI-driven medical analytics for faster diagnostics
# 5. Media Streaming & Content Delivery 
	• Platforms hosting video, audio, or live-streaming services
	• High-performance content distribution using AWS CloudFront
	• Adaptive scaling for millions of concurrent users
# Architecture Breakdown
This three-tier model ensures separation of concerns into distinct layers: 
Frontend (Presentation Layer): Amazon S3 and CloudFront for low-latency content delivery. 
 Backend (Application Layer): EC2 instances with Auto Scaling and Load Balancer for high availability. 
Database (Storage Layer): Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) for secure data handling.
# Technologies Used
	• Compute: EC2 (Auto Scaling, Load Balancer)
	• Storage: S3 (Static Assets), RDS (Transactional Data)
	• Networking: VPC, Subnets, Route Tables
	• Security: IAM, Security Groups, SSL/TLS
	• Monitoring: CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray
	• CI/CD: AWS CodeDeploy for automated deployments
